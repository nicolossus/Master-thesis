    "The ABC methodology, where ABC stands for approxi- mate Bayesian computation, was mentioned as early as 1984 through a pedagogical and philosophical argument in Rubin (1984). It offers an almost automated resolution of the dif- ficulty with models which are intractable but can be simu- lated from. It was first proposed in population genetics by Tavaré et al. (1997), who introduced Approximate Bayesian Computation methods as a rejection technique bypassing the computation of the likelihood function via a simulation from the corresponding distribution. The exact version of the method can only be implemented in a small range of cases. Pritchard et al. (1999) produce a generalisation based on an approximation of the target. We study here the foundations as well as the implementation of the ABC method, with il- lustrations from time series. \n",

    "Unfortunately, we cannot evaluate (2) explicitly. However it is possible to drawn an IID random sample TN = {Θj }Nj=1 (N ∈ N) from the quasi-posterior distribution that is characterized by (2), using the so-called rejection algorithm.\n",

    "Clearly, deciding how to characterize the data is an important choice in the likelihood-free context. Namely, it is impossible to know whether or not a set of statistics is sufficient for the unknown parameters if the likelihood is intractable.\n",
