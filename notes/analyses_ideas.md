## Ideas for Analyses

* $p(\theta |\rho ({\hat{D}, D) \leq \epsilon)$ and $p(\theta |D)$ as a function of $\epsilon$  
* The accuracy of the posterior (defined as the expected quadratic loss) delivered by ABC as a function of $\epsilon$
* Accuracy as a function of the number of data points in observed data
* KL divergence


* acceptance-threshold curve
* number of simulated datapoints vs accuracy
