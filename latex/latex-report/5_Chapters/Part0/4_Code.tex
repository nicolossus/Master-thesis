All code used to carry out the present study is made publicly available in the GitHub repository:

The \cw{pyLFI} package is located in a separate repository:

The \cw{pyLFI} package documentation can be found at:

\textbf{Justify why pyLFI was made} 

\begin{itemize}
    \item computational science master: programming and software development are central aspects
    \item Useful to obtain "under the hood" knowledge in order to find strengths, weaknesses, improvements etc. as well as a thorough understanding 
    \item flexibility. the standardized toolboxes does not necessarily facilitate the means for analyses we want to carry out 
    \item we will however use standard toolboxes for both comparison and analyses, as they have several years of development behind them and offers more complex/refined and efficient software
\end{itemize}
