the sensitivity of the model output , 

Next, we carry out a sensitivity analysis of 

let us characterize the effects of parameter uncertainty on the output of the model in terms of the summary statistics.  

a sensitivity quantifies how much the uncertainty in the model output each model parameter is responsible for.
