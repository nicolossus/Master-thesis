The present work was conducted at the Centre for Integrative Neuroplasticity (CINPLA) and the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo, under the supervision of professor Gaute T. Einevoll, associate professor Joakim Sundnes, professor Aslak Tveito and Dr. Alexander Stasik. 

First of all, I want to thank my excellent supervisors. To Alex, thank you for providing valuable guidance and insight in the planning and development of this thesis. To Aslak, my sincere gratitude for all the help with the formalities. To Joakim, I am deeply grateful for the support and also the constructive suggestions on the code. To Gaute, I want to give a special thanks for both introducing me to the fascinating field of computational neuroscience and your great support. I appreciate the great amount of freedom you gave me to explore the aspects that interested me the most. Our regular meetings have been of invaluable help. Thank you for taking the time. 

I want to extend a thanks to the friendly group of fellow students, especially Kristian Wold and Christer Dreierstad, for the teamwork, inspiring conversations and good times. I also want to thank the members of CINPLA for creating such a friendly environment and pleasant place to be. 

I would like to thank my friends and family, especially my parents for their unconditional support and love in my years as a student in physics and computational science. I would also like to express my gratitude towards my partner Oda Hovet for her endless support throughout my degree.
