Likelihood Function & (data generating process)
\\
Likelihood-free Inference & Inference methods that bypass explicit evaluation of the likelihood function.
\\
Prior Density & Beliefs, or uncertainty, placed on a random parameter prior to observing data. 
\\ 
Posterior Density & Updated beliefs, or uncertainty, through Bayes's theorem, on a random parameter in the light of observed data. 
\\
(Mechanistic) Simulator & A causal model, usually defined through a set of dynamical equations, that can be run forward to generate data. Such simulators usually have intractable likelihoods. 
\\ 
Dipole Blockade & Phenomenon in which the simultaneous excitation of two atoms is inhibited by their dipolar interaction. 
\\
Cavity Induced Transparency & Phenomenon in which a cavity containing two atoms excited with light at a frequency halfway between the atomic frequencies contains the number of photons an empty cavity would contain.
